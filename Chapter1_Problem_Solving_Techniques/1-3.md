# Different sliding tile puzzle strategy

## Recursive solution

We can observe that for every puzzle state there are maximum 4 puzzles to move.

0 - blank tile

```
1 2 3 
4 0 5 ---> Tiles we can move are: 2, 4, 5, 6
7 6 8
```

Having the solution as a base case for recursion we can create an algorithm.

### Steps:

1. Pop game state from deque end.
2. If current game state is on the _checked set_
start again.
3. If current game state is the base case return moves list.
4. Add current game state to the _checked set_.
5. Find possible moves. Perform them and append new states to the dequeue end.
6. Start again
