# Sudoku solving plan

1. Work on all 3x3 squares separately one after the other.
2. For each square add numbers which already are in that square to _used numbers list_.
3. For each empty tile check if the is only one number not present both in _used numbers list_
and not in vertical or horizontal axis. If yes write this number.
4. Repeat the process until the puzzle is fully solved - all tiles have a number.
