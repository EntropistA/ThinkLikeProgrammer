# Sliding puzzle with tiles covered with a picture instead of numbers

In order to solve this puzzle we would need a completed puzzle picture.

Difficulty would increase if the program needed to use picture recognition to number
all the split pictures.

1. Make a table out of the solution picture.
2. Combine all the table elements with a number.
3. Solve the puzzle using numbers.
4. Translate back to the picture format in the end.
