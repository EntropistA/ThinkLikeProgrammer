## Chapter 1

### Always have a plan

Even if the task seems insanely difficult one can move forward the answer by
trying different methods on the problem set.

### Restate the Problem

Many times the best way to come up with a solution is to compare the task with previous ones solved.
The similarity between two might be ambiguous but spending time on understanding the problem deeply
should make patterns obvious.

### Divide the Problem

Just as *Divide and Conquer* algorithmic paradigm states.
In certain scenarios full size task comes with so many cases to take in mind that writing
the code to handle all of them seems impossible.
Trying with the easiest, smallest data set lets you not only understand the idea behind but as well 
places you on path to produce an answer by splitting the main problem into solvable pieces.

### Start with What You Know

List all the different actions you can take on the input data.
Focus on those obvious ones first and then use them for create more abstract methods.

### Reduce the problem

Think what really matters in the task data.
Then think how you can get rid of the rest, so you can work on a smaller set.

### Look for analogies

Look on the problem and ask yourself - "Have I ever stumbled across such an exercise?"
Remind yourself what techniques did the solution have.

### Experiment

If you are really stuck just use the all the methods which you know.
Try different data sets and constantly look for analogies, patterns.

### Don't Get Frustrated

Remember that frustration evidently lowers ability to come up with a solution.
Before solving a problem think how can you make your mind return to the calm state
when nothing seems to draw you forward a solution.
